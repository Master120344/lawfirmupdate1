                <p>The Kershaw Law Firm P.C. holds the confidentiality of your information in the highest regard. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. Information is shared only under specific circumstances, primarily to advance your legal case or as required by law, and always with a commitment to protecting your privacy.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Government Agencies:</strong> To process H-2A and H-2B visa petitions, we must share required information with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the U.S. Department of State (including consular posts abroad), and potentially other U.S. government entities involved in the immigration process. The information shared is strictly what is necessary for these applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third Party Service Providers:</strong> We may engage trusted third party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf. These can include IT support and maintenance, cloud data storage, document management systems, payment processing, translation services, courier services, and professional advisors (such as accountants or specialized consultants, if needed for a case). These providers are given access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Requirements and Law Enforcement:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, court order, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent fraud, act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our clients or the public, or to protect against legal liability. Such disclosures are made in accordance with attorney client privilege and ethical rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>With Your Explicit Consent:</strong> We may share your information with other third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so. For example, if you ask us to share information with a new legal counsel or another party.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregated or De identified Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or de identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you, for statistical analysis, research, or to improve our services.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The attorney client privilege is a cornerstone of our practice. Information you provide to us for the purpose of obtaining legal advice is protected by this privilege and will not be disclosed except in very limited circumstances permitted by law and ethical rules (such as to prevent a future crime or with your informed consent).</p>

                 <p><em>The following information is provided as general guidance and examples. Specific legal requirements vary by jurisdiction. This section, in particular, should be reviewed and customized by legal counsel familiar with data protection laws applicable to your Firm’s clients and operations (e.g., CCPA/CPRA for California residents, GDPR for individuals in Europe, etc.).</em></p>
                 <h4>Example: For California Residents</h4>
                 <p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). These rights may include the Right to Know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold; the Right to Delete personal information; the Right to Opt Out of the sale or sharing of personal information (The Kershaw Law Firm P.C. does not currently sell personal information); the Right to Correct inaccurate personal information; and the Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information in Section 13. You will not be discriminated against for exercising your CCPA/CPRA rights.</p>
                 <h4>Example: For Individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, and Switzerland</h4>
                 <p>If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, your personal data is protected by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or similar local laws. Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. This may include processing necessary for the performance of a contract (our engagement letter), compliance with a legal obligation, protection of vital interests, or for our legitimate interests where not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. You have rights under GDPR including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object to processing.
